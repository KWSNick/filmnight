# Site Purpose
A demonstration website for a fictional online movie store which would allow
a user to purchase both digital and hard copies of movies for instant access
and product delivery. 

The user can browse a range of titles, add them to a shopping basket, amend
the basket and checkout securely. Their digitally owned titles appear in a
separated list and these titles are removed from the main shopping browsing
list for the user. Further hard copies of digitally owned movies can be
purchased but the user is prevented from purchasing a digital movie once it
is owned.

The user would be able to access the digital content via the site were this a
a real service.
